# ConvexAuctionBot
### Docker Image
`docker pull bugg86/convex-auction-bot`

When doing this you will need to run a container using interactive mode so you can enter your token for use in the bot. You should only have to do this once.

### Other Build Options
You can build your own docker image using the Dockerfile included in the repository.

This repo can also be built and ran without using a docker container, it's up to you how you want to deploy and use the bot :)
